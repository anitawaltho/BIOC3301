This resulting sequence data was processed using QIIME (Quantitative Insight Into Microbial Ecology) 1.9.1 on UCL legion. 
Pre-processing was carried out (removing primers and adapters, demultiplexing and quality filter)
This was followed by close reference based picking of OTUs with Greengenes using buclust to build an OTU table. 

Further sequence analysis was conducted on the sequence data from both years using QIIME on MacBook Terminal through Miniconda command line.
